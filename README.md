## üì≤ Blynk Integration

- **Virtual Pins**:  
  - `V1` ‚Üí Temperature  
  - `V2` ‚Üí Humidity  
  - `V3` ‚Üí Gas Level  
  - `V4` ‚Üí Rain Sensor

- **Push Notification**:  
  - Triggered when gas level exceeds `2500` via Blynk `logEvent()`.

## üß† How It Works

1. ESP32 reads sensor data every 2 seconds.
2. Displays real-time values on the LCD screen.
3. Sends data to Blynk IoT cloud for remote access.
4. Triggers buzzer and LED if gas crosses threshold.
5. Sends mobile notification via Blynk app.

## üß™ Code Logic Snapshot

```cpp
float temp = dht.readTemperature();
float hum = dht.readHumidity();
int gasValue = analogRead(MQ8PIN);
int rainValue = analogRead(RAINPIN);

if (gasValue > 2500 && !alertSent) {
  digitalWrite(BUZZER, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  Blynk.logEvent("gas_alert", "High gas level detected!");
  alertSent = true;
}
```

### üìã Summary

This Smart Weather Monitoring System is built using ESP32 along with DHT11, MQ-8, and a rain sensor to measure temperature, humidity, gas levels, and rainfall. The data is displayed locally on an I2C LCD and sent to the Blynk Cloud for remote monitoring. If hydrogen gas levels exceed a safe threshold, the system activates a buzzer and LED for alerts and sends a push notification via the Blynk app. This project provides an efficient, real-time solution for weather tracking and gas hazard alerts, making it suitable for smart home, industrial, or educational use.
